# Deep learning graph classification 

This project takes up the paper An End-to-End [Deep Learning Architecture for 
Graph Classification (Zhang et al., AAAI 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11782) and experiments with graph 
classification on multiple datasets. The idea is to classify "whole graphs", 
not nodes.

## Datasets
We explore the results with two datasets used by the publication's authors, one from bioinformatics: PROTEINS, 
and the other from social networks: IMDB-B.
The datasets are available [here](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11782).
